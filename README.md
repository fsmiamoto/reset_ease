# reset_ease
A little script for Anki to reset the ease factor of cards

You can just add it to your add-on's folder and a option called "Reset Ease Factor" should appear in the tools menu
To customize the cards you actually wanna change the ease factor, there are comments in the code that will hopefully help you.
